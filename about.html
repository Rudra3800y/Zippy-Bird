  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This website features a fun, lightweight browser game called 
    <a href="/index.html">Zippy Bird</a> ‚Äî a tribute to the classic tap-and-dodge gameplay style. 
    It‚Äôs built completely from scratch using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> ‚Äî no fancy game engines, just code and creativity.
  </p>

  <p>I made <strong>Zippy Bird</strong> as a personal project to improve my web development skills and bring a little fun to anyone who visits. 
    Whether you're here to beat your high score or just passing time, I hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed building it.
  </p>

  <p>Feel free to share the game with friends, and don‚Äôt forget to flap responsibly! üê§</p>
